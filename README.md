 Hey, thanks for stopping by. If you don't know me, my name is Victor Sullivan.  I am a U.S Army Veteran former Deputy Sheriff and aspiring future Tech-World Employee.  What is this README all about?  Well, it's about me.  More than that though, it's about my decision to change careers and enter the tech industry at 41.

 I come from a small town in Central California, where the population of the Navy Base just outside the "Welcome" sign was more than the actual town. My family was more like a season of "Jerry Springer" than The Cleavers. I moved out at 14 years old.  I'm still not sure "moved out" is the proper term, but it sounds better than runaway. Besides to be a runaway someone would need to report the absence and that didn't happen.  

 I was helped by several adults in my early life many of whom I still have contact with.  I doubt I would be where I am today without them.  After being graduated from High School Joining the Army was my way out.  My 8 years in the military were some of the best and worst years of my life.  Anyone who has served knows what I mean. I served in Korea, Hawaii, Ft. Lewis and completed one tour in Afghanistan.  After leaving the military I joined the Pierce County Sheriff's Department as a Deputy Sheriff.  From that point I opened a couple restaurants and worked for the IBEW local 46 as an Installer.  I have ran more feet of Cat6 cable than I care to remember.  I jacked cables, installed UPS units, server racks and WAPs. Computers and technology have always been my passion and the pandemic allowed me to chase my dream in tech.  Oh, and my amazing supportive wife Natasha.

 So, here I am.  I completed the CodeFellows boot-camp Software Development track ending with JAVA 401 and now I am studying in the Operations track. Like I said before, a lot of people helped me get here. Some still are. Throughout my life I have gravitated toward helping others. This is why technology is so important to me.  I want to continue to serve in the tech world.  Work with a purpose.  Tech is the field where millions can be helped or protected with the proper knowledge and dedication.  I will build the necessary skills to ensure I am a valuable asset to any company I work for.
