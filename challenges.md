# Ops-201 Challenges

### I do not have a favorite here. There is a lot of power in scripting.  Finding the intricacies in the way Bash and PowerShell function are subtle but important.  I enjoy finding the correct syntax and will go over all of the scripts I have written so far and try for the same outcome in both languages. 

### Scripting and automation are incredibly important.  Saving both time and money as well as freeing up resources for other tasks.  I look forward to improving my knowledge of cmdlets and piping.  These two things are essential for pulling the information you want in a useful manner.

- Print to the terminal screen all active processes ordered by highest Process Identification Number at the top.
- Print to the terminal screen the top five active processes ordered by highest Working Set (WS(K)) at the top.
- Start the process Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) and have it open https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/.
- Start the process Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) ten times using a for loop. Have each instance open https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/.
- Close all Internet Explorer windows.
- Kill a process by its Process Identification Number. Choose a process whose termination wonâ€™t destabilize the system, such as Internet Explorer or MS Edge.
